                If I was forced to only play one game for the rest of my life, it would be Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune. Wangan or WMMT is a racing video game which was inspired from an actual club of drivers who drive at night on the Wangan Line, which is the longest and straightest road in Japan in Tokyo Bay. In here you get to race with your friends or other players, some might be even from other countries.

                What really makes this arcade machine stand out from the rest is the one-to-six gear shift. It’s still user-friendly for new comers as they offer the automatic transmission, but you can still change your car’s transmission to manual along the way to give you that pride, just in like in real life racing. The shift gear’s tactile feedback really makes contributes well to the immersion. The two speakers at the back of your head also takes the racing experience to a whole new level. It really gives you main-character energy, especially when you are listening to your favorite song from the WMMT music library. Mine is Love and Gold.

                Let’s talk about cars, as of time of writing, there are 88 cars to choose from. There are cars that are best for drifting (like Mazda’s RX-8), for straight line (like GTR’s R35), for battling (like Mitsubishi’s Evo 9), for time attacks (like Mazda’s RX-7), and so on. You can also get other cars from other means such as:

                <br>
                    1. bingo scratch at the arcade machine (once a day)
                    <br>
                    2.“lottery” scratch every 3 games in the Wangan Navigator Mobile App
                    <br>
                    3.Attending/participating to special events such as tournaments or limited edition
                    <br><br>
                    Another thing that this game nails is that there is a simplified tuning portion which happens before the race. In here you have to put how much handling and power (or horsepower) you like. Later on, you’ll realize that there is a perfect balance/tuning/setting per car and per map. As you can see, this makes the game’s replayability very good! When you finish wining the story mode, which takes about 80 games, you obtain your car’s full tuning, or as the game calls it, Hell’s Tuning.

                    Now let’s talk about ranking and class record. In this game, there are multiple ways for players to get to a top spot. First there are regional ranking which shows your number of wins and your rating which is directly related to how long a player has been playing. There is also the VS Ranking which shows how many VS battles a player has one. The difference between the two is that the VS battle has both players playing at the same arcade place, while the Ghost battles / Time Attack battles are games wherein you are playing against a “softcopy” version of the actual player. What I love about this is that they actually record very well the behavior and the way the player drives. Last but not the least, the animal grade. Before the race starts, there is this animation in VS battle wherein all the cars would line up and do a little drift and the name of the user would pop up beside the car. If you reach a certain number of VS battle wins, you get to have an animal aura. It would float behind your car. Each rank has different animals. That first feeling of having an aura really do feels nice. Remember what I said about the animation before the race? I feel like it adds a little bit of “fear factor” to the enemy, especially the ones who don’t have any animal grade aura. Finally, the aura’s size would also depend on the player’s mileage.

                    Now let’s talk about the negatives. It’s mostly the players. There are some people who we call “fishers”. These are players who challenge VS battles against guests or first-timers. The sad thing about this is that they would have no clue as to why the “fisher’s car” is way more faster  than theirs. The reason this is prevalent is because this is the fastest way to get the number of VS wins, which gives you the animal aura quickly. Plus another thing is that the winner of every VS battle get to have 1 free play, and the rest have to add tokens or swipe up if they want to challenge you again. The second group is what we call the “Bruce Lee”. I’ll explain. There are these players who are just insensitive that they literally smack or steer the steering wheel very hard, which sometimes lead to the screen blacking out. In some cases, the wheel actually comes off. They would also shift gears aggressively as they can, which sometimes breaks the arcade machine. I really cringe every time I play against one or see them in social media, because they are very inconsiderate to the next player.

                    Overall, this game is really fun! You get to learn more about the DevilZ and BlackBird along the way. You have tons of customizations, from the rims, the lights, hood, spoilers, plate number, etc. You get to know more about the real tracks/highways in Japan. And sooner or later you’ll get to be a King of a track, or even be placed on the leader boards. But in my opinion, just like in any game, it’s always best played with friends.
